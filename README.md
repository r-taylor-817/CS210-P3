This project was created for the sake of acadamia and to test the skills developed through the CS-210 Programming Languages course at Southern New Hampshire University.

This app takes input for a file name, reads the file contents into a map along with the frequency of which the items appear in the input file, and prints the items and their frequency into a new file.
The application then displays a screen that prompts the user for numeric input (between 1 - 4) and performs functions that may allow the user to search for an item and it's frequency, print a list of the present items and their frequency, print a list of the items with their frequencies represented by a histogram, or quit the application.

This project was completed on 12/17/2023.
