This project was designed to display in different ways the frequency at which items were purchased from a grocery store. This is done by reading a file that displays the items bought at the grocery store in one day and storing the item in a list (map) with the frequency at which each item appears in the file. There are several functions impletmented that allow the user to check for items and see their frequency. The user may then search for an item and see if the item is present in the list, and if so they may see how many times that item was bought in one day. The user may also print a list of the items present in the file alongside the frequency in which the items appear in the list. Two different functions do this, with one displaying the frequency as a numeric value and the other displaying the frequency as a histogram. The fourth user option allows the user to quit the program if the number 4 is entered at the main menu.

In this project, I feel I did a good job of encapsulating the different functions of the program, making the main file easier to read and the entirety of the code easier to navigate. The main functions of the program are declared in one file and defined in another, as they should be to follow the principles of object-oriented programming. I also created a function to read the contents of an input file and save its contents in a map, with this function taking the file name as a parameter. I wrote another function to create a new file and store the items present in the map created by the input file function into the new file, along with the item's frequencies. The other aspect of this program that I am proud of is that the inline comments in the program are thorough and descriptive.

My code in this project could be enhanced by implementing user input validation. Without validation of the user's input when the user is prompted to enter a value between 1 and 4, there is the possibility that incorrect input may cause the program to malfunction. With input validation, the program could loop freely without bugs and allow the console to simply prompt the user for correct input if invalid input is given. I also feel that in the definition of the printHistogram function, I could have possibly found a way to simplify this function's definition by using the data already stored in the map that was created when the input file was read. Instead, this function takes
